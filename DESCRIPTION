Description: A ggplot2 based implementation of biplots, giving a representation of a dataset in
    a two dimensional space accounting for the greatest variance, together with variable vectors
    showing how the data variables relate to this space. It provides a 
    replacement for stats::biplot(), but with many enhancements to control the analysis and
    graphical display. It implements 
    biplot and scree plot methods using ggplot2 which can be used with the results of prcomp(), princomp(),
    FactoMineR::PCA() or MASS::lda() and can be customized using ggplot2 techniques.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)

    ggplot2, scales
