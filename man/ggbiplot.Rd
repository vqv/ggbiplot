When \code{scale = 1} (the default), the inner product 
between the variables approximates the covariance and the distance between the points 
approximates the Mahalanobis distance.}

\item{pc.biplot}{Logical, for compatibility with \code{biplot.princomp()}. If \code{TRUE}, use what Gabriel (1971) 
refers to as a "principal component biplot", with \eqn{\alpha = 1} and observations scaled 
up by sqrt(n) and variables scaled down by sqrt(n). Then inner products between 
variables approximate covariances and distances between observations approximate 
Mahalanobis distance.}

\item{obs.scale}{Scale factor to apply to observations}

\item{var.factor}{Factor to be applied to variable vectors after scaling. This allows the variable vectors to be reflected
(\code{var.factor = -1}) or expanded in length (\code{var.factor > 1}) for greater visibility.
\code{\link{reflect}} provides a simpler way to reflect the variables.}

If provided the points will be colored according to groups and this allows data ellipses also

\description{
A biplot simultaneously displays information on the observations (as points)
and the variables (as vectors) in a multidimensional dataset. The 2D biplot
is typically based on the first two principal components of a dataset, giving a rank 2 approximation 
to the data. The “bi” in biplot refers to the fact that two sets of points (i.e., the rows and
columns of the data matrix) are visualized by scalar products, not the fact
that the display is usually two-dimensional.

The biplot method for principal component analysis was originally defined by Gabriel (1971, 1981).
Gower & Hand (1996) give a more complete treatment. Greenacre (2010) is a practical user-oriented guide to biplots.
Gower et al. (2011) is the most up to date
exposition of biplot methodology.

\details{
The biplot is constructed by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain a low-rank 
approximation to the data matrix \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{n \times p}} (centered, and optionally scaled to unit variances)
whose \eqn{n} rows are the observations 
and whose \eqn{p} columns are the variables. 

Using the SVD, the matrix \eqn{\mathbf{X}}, of rank \eqn{r \le p}
can be expressed \emph{exactly} as
\deqn{\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Lambda} \mathbf{V}'
                 = \Sigma_i^r \lambda_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i' \; ,}

where 
\itemize{
   \item \eqn{\mathbf{U}} is an \eqn{n \times r} orthonormal matrix of observation scores; these are also the eigenvectors
         of \eqn{\mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}'},
   \item \eqn{\mathbf{\Lambda}} is an \eqn{r \times r} diagonal matrix of singular values, 
         \eqn{\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \cdots \lambda_r} 
        % which are also the square roots
        % of the eigenvalues of \eqn{\mathbf{X} \mathbf{X}'}. 
   \item \eqn{\mathbf{V}} is an \eqn{r \times p} orthonormal matrix of variable weights and also the eigenvectors
         of \eqn{\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X}}.
}

Then, a rank 2 (or 3) PCA approximation \eqn{\widehat{\mathbf{X}}} to the data matrix used in the biplot
can be obtained from the first 2 (or 3)
singular values \eqn{\lambda_i}
and the corresponding \eqn{\mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{v}_i} as

\deqn{\mathbf{X} \approx \widehat{\mathbf{X}} = \lambda_1 \mathbf{u}_1 \mathbf{v}_1' + \lambda_2 \mathbf{u}_2 \mathbf{v}_2' \; .}

The variance of \eqn{\mathbf{X}} accounted for by each term is \eqn{\lambda_i^2}.

The biplot is then obtained by overlaying two scatterplots that share a common set of axes and have a between-set scalar 
product interpretation. Typically, the observations (rows of \eqn{\mathbf{X}}) are represented as points
and the variables (columns of \eqn{\mathbf{X}}) are represented as vectors from the origin.

The \code{scale} factor, \eqn{\alpha} allows the variances of the components to be apportioned between the
row points and column vectors, with different interpretations, by representing the approximation
\eqn{\widehat{\mathbf{X}}} as the product of two matrices,

\deqn{\widehat{\mathbf{X}} = (\mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Lambda}^\alpha) (\mathbf{\Lambda}^{1-\alpha} \mathbf{V}')}

The choice \eqn{\alpha = 1}, assigning the singular values totally to the left factor,
 gives a distance interpretation to the row display and 
\eqn{\alpha = 0} gives a distance interpretation to the column display.
\eqn{\alpha = 1/2} gives a symmetrically scaled biplot.

When the singular values are assigned totally to the left or to the right factor, the resultant 
coordinates are called \emph{principal coordinates} and the sum of squared coordinates
on each dimension equal the corresponding singular value.
The other matrix, to which no part of the singular 
values is assigned, contains the so-called \emph{standard coordinates} and have sum of squared
values equal to 1.0.
