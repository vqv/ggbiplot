## Test environments

* Windows 10, R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt)
* win-builder, R Under development (unstable) (2023-09-12 r85134 ucrt)

* This is considered a new release, against the published CRAN version, 0.55,
due to a change in maintainer

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Biplots (3:42)
  biplot (17:5)
  biplots (12:48)
  ggplot (3:10, 12:16, 17:41, 18:66)

These are all spurious false alarms, owing to win-builder not recognizing the spelling WORDFILE
